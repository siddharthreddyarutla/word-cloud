# word-cloud
Here is the python code which graphically represents the word frequency that give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in a source text. The larger the word in the visual the more common the word was in the document.

For this project, you'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from your dictionary.
