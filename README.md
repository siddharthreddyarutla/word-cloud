# word-cloud
Here is the python code which graphically represents the word frequency that give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in a source text. The larger the word in the visual the more common the word was in the document.

For this project, you'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from your dictionary.

<h2>Things to remember</h2>

Before processing any text, you need to remove all the punctuation marks. To do this, you can go through each line of text, character-by-character, using the isalpha() method. This will check whether or not the character is a letter.
To split a line of text into words, you can use the split() method.
Before storing words in the frequency dictionary, check if theyâ€™re part of the "uninteresting" set of words (for example: "a", "the", "to", "if"). Make this set a parameter to your function so that you can change it if necessary.
